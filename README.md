# Mirai - AI-Powered Robot Arm Simulator

Mirai is a browser-first robotics platform that lets users design robot arms, generate tasks from natural language, validate plans, run physics simulation, and export hardware-ready code.

Built for the Transforming Enterprise Through AI Hackathon (Track 3: Robotics and Simulation).

## Live Demo

- Frontend app: https://mirai-tech-ex-hackathon-transformin.vercel.app
- Backend API: https://production.up.railway.app
- Repository: https://github.com/Mizunandayo/mirai

## Quick Demo Flow (For Judges)

1. Open the frontend app.
2. Go to Design and load a robot preset.
3. Go to Tasks and generate a plan from natural language.
4. Review AI pre-flight validation status.
5. Run simulation and verify playback.
6. Export artifacts (Arduino, Python, BOM, URDF, signed ZIP).

## Current Project State (May 2026)

- Core build complete through Day 7 milestones.
- Day 8 polish and submission tasks are in progress.
- 60fps in-browser simulation flow is implemented with deterministic motion playback.
- Dual-physics architecture is live:
	- Rapier WASM in browser for real-time simulation.
	- MuJoCo on backend for validation, divergence checks, and servo lifespan prediction.
- Gemini-powered planning and repair workflow is integrated in the task editor.
- Community library is implemented with seeded tasks and famous preloads.
- Export pipeline is live for Arduino, Python, BOM, URDF, and signed ZIP bundles.

## What Mirai Does

- Design custom robot arms in 3D with segment and gripper configuration.
- Define tasks through a visual graph editor or natural language input.
- Generate structured plans using Gemini based on scene and arm context.
- Run deterministic safety and feasibility checks before simulation.
- Simulate tasks in-browser at interactive framerates.
- Validate execution accuracy against MuJoCo backend simulation.
- Export build-ready artifacts for real hardware workflows.

## Core Pipeline

1. SceneGraph
2. TaskSpec
3. ValidationReport
4. ExecutionPlan
5. Rapier simulation (client)
6. MuJoCo validation (server)
7. Export bundle generation

## Tech Stack

## Quick Start

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
pip install -r server/requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure environment

Create a local environment file from .env.example and provide your keys and secrets.

Required values include:

- GEMINI_API_KEY
- JWT_SECRET
- DATABASE_URL
- VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY (optional but recommended for direct frontend Gemini flow)

### 3. Run frontend

```bash
npm run dev
```

Frontend default URL: http://localhost:5173

### 4. Run backend

```bash
cd server
python -m uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Backend default URL: http://localhost:8000

## Common Scripts

```bash
npm run dev
npm run build
npm run preview
npm run test:e2e
```
