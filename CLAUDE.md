## WHAT MIRAI DOES

Browser-based AI-powered robot arm simulator that makes robotics accessible to everyone — zero install, zero coding required.

**Core flow:**
1. User designs a robot arm in 3D (segment panel, gripper library, joint config)
2. Types or speaks a task in plain English ("pick up socks and fold them into the drawer")
3. Gemini grounds the request against the current arm + scene and returns a structured `TaskSpec`
4. Mirai verifies and repairs unsafe or unreachable steps, then compiles them into deterministic motion skills
5. Rapier WASM physics engine simulates the verified plan at 60fps in the browser
6. MuJoCo (server-side) validates accuracy and predicts servo lifespan
7. User downloads Arduino `.ino` / Python `.py` code + BOM to build for under $300

**The key differentiator:** Zero setup, natural language input, real physics validation, community task sharing, bridge to real hardware — all in one browser tab.

**Execution truth (must stay true):**
- Gemini never drives joints or servos directly.
- Mirai converts language into `SceneGraph -> TaskSpec -> ValidationReport -> ExecutionPlan`.
- A deterministic verifier can reject or repair plans before any physics runs.
- V1 natural-language support starts with rigid-object verbs (`pick`, `place`, `stack`, `sort`, `move`) plus one curated cloth-folding demo, not arbitrary open-world commands.

- ✅ `src/App.css` — task-*, palette-*, flow-*, task-edge-* styles appended; dot-indicator node design (no left border); semantic toggle colors; edge delete button

**UX polish applied during session:**
- ✅ All node bodies use `nodrag` class — only the header stripe initiates node drag
- ✅ Force slider uses `nodrag` — no React Flow drag hijacking
- ✅ Delete (×) button on every deletable node header — `deleteElements` via useReactFlow
- ✅ GripNode open/close: green active (`#15803d`) / red active (`#991b1b`)
- ✅ Edge delete: transparent 36×36 hit zone at midpoint, fades in on hover or edge selection
- ✅ Task flow now persists across full webpage reload via local storage
- ✅ Clear-task UX shipped: red-outline trash control above zoom controls with Clear all confirmation dialog; clear action resets flow and task-name local storage

**Deliverable:** Visual task programmer with 7 node types, validation, drag-to-add palette, deletable edges, Ctrl+S export, Ctrl+Z undo, portable JSON download.

### Day 4 (May 14) — Physics Simulation (Rapier WASM)

**Architecture:** FK-driven arm (kinematic, deterministic) + Rapier for environment objects + FABRIK IK solver

**New files:**
- `src/types/simulation.ts` — SimFrame, ExecutionPlan, PlaybackStatus, JointMetrics
- `src/utils/forwardKinematics.ts` — FK for serial arm (Y-up, cumulative pitch + waist yaw)
- `src/utils/inverseKinematics.ts` — FABRIK IK (N joints, 2D plane + yaw decomposition)
- `src/utils/motionCompiler.ts` — compileTask(): graph traversal → SimFrame[] with baked IK + collision check
- `src/store/simAtoms.ts` — compiledPlan, playbackStatus, currentFrame, playbackSpeed, pathTrail (derived), `ptpSequencePlaying`
- `src/components/simulation/SceneObjects.tsx` — env objects with Rapier bodies (fixed surfaces, dynamic boxes/cylinders)
- `src/components/simulation/SimulatedArm.tsx` — FK-driven NESTED GROUP arm (proper articulation), kinematic Rapier sphere at gripper, hover/drag teach hooks
- `src/components/simulation/PathTrail.tsx` — glowing end-effector trail (BufferGeometry, pre-allocated)
- `src/components/simulation/SimViewer.tsx` — R3F Canvas + Physics wrapper + useSimPlayback() engine + manual teach/PTP controls + editable live XYZ + PTP Play-all + playback/teach interlocks
- `src/components/simulation/PlaybackControls.tsx` — compile + play/pause/step/rewind + 5 speed presets + PTP-sequence disable state + loaded task metadata name in header
- `src/components/simulation/TimelineScrubber.tsx` — seekable timeline with collision markers
- `src/components/simulation/JointHUD.tsx` — J0–JN angles + torque + velocity + at-limit highlight
- `src/components/simulation/PhysicsMetrics.tsx` — per-joint torque/speed cards + collision alert
- `src/components/simulation/SimulationPanel.tsx` — sidebar composing all sim UI

**Key decisions:**
- Arm uses FK (not Rapier joints) — deterministic, no instability
- Environment uses Rapier dynamic bodies — boxes physically react to kinematic gripper sphere
- All IK solved at compile time — render loop is pure lookup, guaranteed 60fps
- Collision detection baked into frames via AABB — reliable, not Rapier event-dependent
- SegmentChain is a recursive component — rotations accumulate via nested Three.js groups

- ✅ Task executor + deterministic motion compiler are operational (`TaskSpec` graph -> `ExecutionPlan` frames)
- ✅ Browser skill executor supports the current rigid-object pick/place flow
- ✅ Playback controls live: compile, play/pause, rewind, step, speed 0.25x–4x, jump-to-end
- ✅ Loop toggle + skip-collision-pause toggle wired via Jotai (`loopAtom`, `skipCollisionPauseAtom`)
- ✅ Reverse playback + reset controls added to transport
- ✅ Timeline scrubber live with collision markers + grip-empty warning markers
- ✅ Joint HUD + Physics metrics panels live and continuously updated
- ✅ Environment objects are active in scene + collision warnings now include surfaces (shelf/table)
- ✅ Camera focus-cycle and reset controls added to SimViewer
- ✅ Live tool-point coordinate readout (X/Y) added to simulation viewport (bottom-right)
- ✅ Physics metrics switched to per-joint line-by-line row layout
- ✅ Dynamic object reset on loop/rewind frame 0 (translation/rotation/velocities reset)
- ✅ Grip carry no-snap offset tracking implemented
- ✅ Approach-target freeze + runtime-correct grab alignment implemented (`approachTargetId` in `SimFrame`)
- ✅ Tasks canvas state now persists when switching tabs away from and back to Tasks
- ✅ Rapier rigid body per arm segment (Box + Cylinder colliders)
- ✅ Joint constraints — revolute (rotating), prismatic (sliding)
- ✅ Collision highlight mesh flash polish

**Deliverable:** Smooth 60fps physics simulation. Collision detection working.

### Day 5 (May 15) — Gemini AI Integration 🏆 CRITICAL DAY

**Core AI:**
- ❌ FastAPI `POST /ai/plan` endpoint — Gemini Flash integration
- ❌ FastAPI `POST /ai/repair` endpoint — constrained repair loop for invalid or unsafe plans
- ❌ Arm-aware prompt construction (injects arm specs into every call)
- ❌ Grounded prompt builder — injects `SceneGraph`, arm profile, and allowed skill list into every request
- ❌ Structured JSON output parsing + validation
- ❌ TaskSpec-only output contract — Gemini returns typed skills, never direct joint commands
- ❌ Static verifier loop — reach, payload, collision, and precondition checks before simulation
- ❌ Auto-populate React Flow canvas from Gemini-returned task JSON
- ❌ Conversational refinement — "make it slower at step 3"
- ❌ Gemini Pro error diagnosis — plain English failure explanation
- ❌ Loading states + streaming indicator + error handling
- ❌ Supported-language scope v1 — `pick`, `place`, `stack`, `sort`, `move`; cloth folding ships only as curated scenario

**Critical AI Features:**
- ❌ **Voice input** — record audio → Gemini multimodal → task program (demo wow moment)
- ❌ **AI confidence score badge** — "87% confident — J3 near limit at step 4"
- ❌ **Side-by-side mode** — simulation left, live generated code right, synced
- ❌ **Pre-flight safety check** — Gemini audits task + [Fix All with AI] one-click repair
- ❌ **Agentic ReAct loop** — Think→Act→Observe for complex multi-step tasks 🏆
- ❌ **ReAct UI panel** — visible sidebar showing live agent thinking steps 🏆
- ❌ **Natural language arm designer** — "arm reaching 1.2m that lifts 500g" → full config

**Deliverable:** Voice → ReAct loop → pre-flight → confidence score → simulation. Judges MUST see the agent think.

### Day 6 (May 16) — Backend + MuJoCo + Export

**Backend & Physics:**
- ❌ FastAPI backend deployed to Railway (Docker)
- ❌ WebSocket `WS /ws/simulate` — MuJoCo frame streaming
- ❌ MuJoCo MJCF/URDF builder from arm config
- ❌ Task executor in MuJoCo (same task JSON as Rapier)
- ❌ MuJoCo validator consumes the same `ExecutionPlan` produced for Rapier playback
- ❌ Accuracy comparison badge ("94% accurate") in UI
- ❌ Confidence report derived from validation + rule checks, not raw LLM optimism
- ❌ **Physics side-by-side replay** — Rapier (left) vs. MuJoCo (right), divergence frames in red
- ❌ **Servo lifespan predictor** — torque data → predicted hours per joint

**Export:**
- ❌ Jinja2 code gen — Arduino `.ino` + Python `.py` templates (NOT LLM — deterministic)
- ❌ BOM generator from arm config with live AliExpress/Amazon pricing
- ❌ URDF export (ROS2-compatible)
- ❌ **Signed export** — SHA-256 hash header in every downloaded file
- ❌ ZIP bundle — code + BOM + wiring diagram in one `.zip`

**Deliverable:** Dual physics live. Servo lifespan shown. Signed downloads. Full export pipeline operational.

### Day 7 (May 17) — Community + Famous Preloads + Bonus

**Community (browse-only, no auth needed):**
- ❌ Browse page — grid with 3D mini-previews
- ❌ One-click import — Gemini adapts community task to YOUR arm + compatibility %
- ❌ Seeded library — 12 tasks (sock folding, mail sorting, box packing, etc.)

**Famous Preloads (high demo impact):**
- ❌ Boston Dynamics inspection task
- ❌ Tesla Optimus box-stacking task
- ❌ Toyota laundry folding task

**Real Robot Arm Presets (~2h) — Visual upgrade:**
- ❌ Load 2–3 free `.glb` mesh files (UR5, KUKA KR6 — CC-licensed from Sketchfab)
- ❌ "Real Robot" skin toggle in arm designer — replaces procedural mesh, keeps all joint/segment data
- ❌ Gemini adapts community task to the selected real arm's actual joint limits
- ❌ Demo moment: switch from custom builder view → KUKA mesh → same task plays on real geometry

**Quality:**
- ❌ Full E2E test: design → voice → pre-flight → simulate → side-by-side → export
- ❌ 60fps confirmed on mid-range hardware

**Bonus (only if Day 5–6 ahead):**
- ❌ WebSerial live control (5h) — browser → Arduino USB → real servo moves on stage
- ❌ GIF simulation export (2h) — one-click animated GIF

### Day 8 (May 18–19) — Polish + Demo Prep + Submit

**Testing:**
- ❌ Full E2E test
- ❌ Verify SHA-256 hash in downloaded `.ino`
- ❌ 60fps confirmed on mid-range laptop (venue machine)
- ❌ Voice input tested on demo hardware + fallback confirmed

**Deployment:**
- ❌ Frontend → Vercel (production URL)
- ❌ FastAPI → Railway (production URL, Docker)
- ❌ Sentry error tracking on both
- ❌ Demo mode — "sock folding" pre-loaded as landing state

**Submission:**
- ❌ Record 2-min demo video (design → voice → pre-flight → simulate → export)
- ❌ Slide deck (5 slides: problem → solution → demo → market → impact)
- ❌ README.md final pass — screenshots + live demo link
- ❌ Repo cleanup — no `.env`, no `node_modules`, no debug logs
- ❌ **Submit to lablab.ai before 8:00 AM PST May 19** ← HARD DEADLINE

## GEMINI SETUP

- **One API key** covers all models — `GEMINI_API_KEY` in `backend/.env`
- `gemini-2.0-flash` → real-time text/voice arm design (fast, cheap)
- `gemini-2.0-pro` → multi-step motion planning via ReAct loop (smart, deep reasoning)
- Free tier sufficient for the entire hackathon (solo, 8 days, low volume)
- SDK: `@google/generative-ai` v0.21.0 (frontend) + `google-generativeai` 0.21.0 (backend)

---

## ARCHITECTURE

```
Browser (React + Vite)
  → ArmViewer (React Three Fiber + Rapier WASM)
    → 60fps physics simulation — NO server round-trip
  → Task Editor (React Flow)
    → Visual block programming → task JSON
  → Gemini AI (frontend SDK or via FastAPI)
    → Text/voice → task JSON → populates React Flow
    → ReAct agent loop (Think→Act→Observe)
    → TaskEditor-native AI Results (reachability/pickability/config-fix feedback)
  → FastAPI backend (server/main.py → Railway)
    → POST /ai/plan — Gemini orchestration
    → WS /ws/simulate — MuJoCo frame streaming
    → GET /export/code — Jinja2 Arduino/Python generation
    → GET /export/bom — Bill of Materials with pricing
    → MuJoCo (Python) validates Rapier simulation
      → Accuracy badge ("94% accurate")
      → Servo lifespan prediction
```

### Dual Physics Strategy
- **Rapier WASM in-browser:** 60fps with zero server latency — feels like a game engine
- **MuJoCo server-side only:** Python-only, can't run in browser; used for validation not real-time
- UI shows: `"Rapier ✅ 94% accurate | MuJoCo validated"`
- Side-by-side replay: Rapier left, MuJoCo right, divergence frames in red

### Current AI UX Surface (May 15 Update)
- Primary AI workflow is now in **Tasks → TaskEditorPanel** (not AI navbar)
- TaskEditor AI Results includes:
  - Reachability status + failing step details
  - Target pickability status against current arm + gripper + scene
  - One-click `Auto-config Arm` for non-pickable targets
  - ReAct `Think Trace` expandable panel
- Simulation object positions are synced back to shared scene state for AI grounding (realtime scene-aware planning)

### Gemini Integration Strategy
- **Single prompt:** text → task JSON (fast path)
- **ReAct loop:** complex tasks → agent iterates Think→Act→Observe until satisfied
- **Multimodal voice:** Web Audio API → Gemini audio input → task JSON
- **Arm-aware:** every prompt injects current arm config (segments, joint limits, reach)

### Natural Language Execution Strategy
- **`SceneGraph`:** current arm, gripper, workspace objects, named targets, and fold anchors for curated demos
- **`TaskSpec`:** Gemini output expressed only in allowed high-level skills
- **`ValidationReport`:** deterministic checks for reach, payload, collisions, and missing preconditions
- **`ExecutionPlan`:** compiled motion primitives consumed by both Rapier and MuJoCo
- **Repair loop:** invalid `TaskSpec` → `POST /ai/repair` → revalidate until safe or rejected
- **Scope discipline:** first ship rigid-object commands; cloth folding is a curated scenario, not an open-world claim

## KEY ENGINEERING DECISIONS

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| Rapier WASM in-browser | 60fps with zero server latency — feels like a game engine |
| MuJoCo server-side only | Python-only, can't run in browser; used for validation not real-time |
| Constrained neuro-symbolic pipeline | Gemini handles intent; deterministic verifier/compiler handles safety, motion, and export |
| Jinja2 for code export | Deterministic output — LLM hallucinations are dangerous in hardware code |
| React Flow for task editor | Purpose-built for node graphs; drag/drop + custom nodes out of the box |
| Jotai for state | Atomic model maps cleanly to arm segments, task blocks — granular re-renders |
| `@google/generative-ai` SDK | Official Google SDK, handles streaming, multimodal, function calling |
| Web-first (not Tauri-first) | Demo runs at a Vercel URL — judges don't install anything |
| `--legacy-peer-deps` | reactflow v12 has peer dep conflicts with React 19 — flag resolves it |

## DESIGN SYSTEM — UI RULES (enforced, do not break)

These rules apply to every component, every panel, every piece of UI in Mirai. They were set by the developer and must be respected in all AI-assisted edits.

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Font** | `Poppins` exclusively — imported via `@fontsource/poppins` (weights 400, 500, 600, 700) |
| **No emojis** | Never use emoji characters in UI. Use inline SVG icons instead |
| **No small text** | Minimum readable body size: `0.82rem`. Labels: `0.72rem` minimum. No `0.6x` or smaller |
| **No gray text** | Avoid `#aaa`, `#999`, `rgba(0,0,0,0.3)` for meaningful text. Use `#555555` minimum for secondary text, `#0d0d0d` / `#1a1a1a` for primary text |
| **Color theme** | White-primary, black-accent. Background: `#ebebeb`. Surfaces: `#ffffff`. Primary action: `#0d0d0d` |
| **Glass effect** | Floating elements (header, modals, hints) use `background: rgba(255,255,255,0.72)` + `backdrop-filter: blur(24px) saturate(180%)` + white border |
| **Animations** | Smooth — `fade-up` on mount, `cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1)` easing for entrances, `200–360ms` durations |
| **Icons** | Inline SVGs, 14×14 or 16×16 viewBox, `currentColor`, `strokeWidth: 1.5–1.6`. Placed in tinted square containers (`border-radius: 8px`, `28×28px`) |
| **Minimalist** | No decorative gradients, no drop shadows on text, no warm/Anthropic tones (no `#c4694a`, `#e8956a`, `#fdf0ea`) |
| **Ergonomic** | Controls at minimum 32px touch height. Panels `clamp(284px, 22vw, 336px)`. Header 56px. Status bar 44px |

### CSS Namespace Reference
- `hdr-*` — header bar (glass, 3-column grid, centered brand)
- `panel-*` — designer sidebar (white, 16px border-radius)
- `btn-*` — buttons (ghost, primary, topbar variants)
- `segment-*` — arm segment rows
- `gripper-*` — gripper library cards
- `validation-*` / `metric-*` — design check panel
- `bom-*` — bill-of-materials counter
- `viewport-*` — 3D viewport wrapper
- `status-*` — bottom status bar

## SECURITY NOTES

- ⚠️ `GEMINI_API_KEY` is in `backend/.env` — **NEVER COMMIT**
- `.gitignore` covers: `.env`, `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`
- FastAPI CORS is currently `allow_origins=["*"]` — tighten to Vercel domain before deployment
- `python-jose` included for JWT — use for future auth endpoints only
- Signed export uses SHA-256 (not LLM-generated) — deterministic, verifiable

## DEMO STRATEGY

1. **Track 3 — Robotics & Simulation:** Dual physics (Rapier + MuJoCo), 60fps, BOM-to-reality bridge
2. **Demo wow moments for judges:**
   - Speak a task aloud → arm moves in 3 seconds
   - Visible agent thinking sidebar (ReAct loop streaming live)
   - Download code + BOM → immediately buildable for under $300
   - Dual physics side-by-side replay with divergence highlighting
   - Servo lifespan predictor ("J2 will fail in ~180hrs at this load")
